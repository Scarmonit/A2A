## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/A2A.git
   cd A2A
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** following our naming conventions:
   - `feature/<short-desc>[-<ticket>]` - for new features
   - `fix/<short-desc>[-<ticket>]` - for bug fixes
   - `chore/<short-desc>` - for maintenance tasks
   - `hotfix/<short-desc>` - for urgent fixes

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits (see below)

5. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons at the end of statements
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts          # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ agents.ts         # Agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts         # Server configuration
â””â”€â”€ types/            # Type definitions
```

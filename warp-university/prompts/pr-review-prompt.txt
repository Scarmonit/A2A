- [ ] Functions are small and focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Consistent code style
- [ ] Appropriate comments for complex logic
- [ ] No commented-out code

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Output sanitization/encoding
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks
- [ ] Secure dependencies (no known vulnerabilities)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests included
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests if applicable
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Adequate code coverage (80%+)

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Efficient algorithms used
- [ ] Proper caching where applicable
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Asynchronous operations where appropriate

### Architecture
- [ ] Follows project structure
- [ ] Maintains separation of concerns
- [ ] Dependencies injected properly
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] API changes documented

## Review Format

### Summary
Brief overview of changes and overall assessment.

### Strengths
âœ… What the PR does well

### Issues Found

**Critical** ðŸ”´
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes
- Data loss risks

**Major** ðŸŸ¡
- Bugs
- Performance issues
- Missing tests

**Minor** ðŸŸ¢
- Code style
- Documentation
- Suggestions for improvement

### Suggestions
```language
// Example of improved code
```

## Feedback Style
- Be specific: Point to exact lines/files
- Be kind: Assume good intentions
- Be constructive: Suggest solutions, not just problems
- Ask questions: "Could we...?" vs "You should..."
- Praise good work: Acknowledge clever solutions

## Decision Guidelines
- **Approve**: Minor issues only, all critical checks pass
- **Request Changes**: Security issues, bugs, or missing tests
- **Comment**: Questions or suggestions that don't block merge

## Example Comments
**Good**: "Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better testability. What do you think about `extractUserData()`?"

**Avoid**: "This code is messy."

## Final Check
- Does this PR make the codebase better?
- Would I be comfortable debugging this code at 3 AM?
- Is this code reviewable by others on the team?

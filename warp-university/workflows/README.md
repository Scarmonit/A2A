## SQL REPL Commands

### Database Query Templates

```sql
-- Quick schema inspection
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Performance analysis
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
       n_live_tup AS row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Active connections
SELECT pid, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, query_start, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start;
```

### Database Optimization Queries

```sql
-- Find missing indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       seq_scan, seq_tup_read,
       idx_scan, idx_tup_fetch,
       seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg_seq_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 0
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC
LIMIT 25;

-- Vacuum and analyze recommendations
SELECT schemaname, tablename,
       n_dead_tup,
       n_live_tup,
       round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) AS dead_percentage,
       last_vacuum, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

## Best Practices

1. **SQL Commands**:
   - Always use parameterized queries
   - Test on non-production data first
   - Include LIMIT clauses for large result sets
   - Document complex queries

2. **Testing Prompts**:
   - Be specific about test framework and conventions
   - Include context about the application domain
   - Specify coverage requirements
   - Request both positive and negative test cases

3. **PR Reviews**:
   - Use templates consistently across team
   - Customize checklists for project needs
   - Combine manual review with AI assistance
   - Document rationale for significant changes

4. **Agent Profiles**:
   - Maintain separate profiles for different contexts
   - Update profiles based on team feedback
   - Include project-specific conventions
   - Balance detail with flexibility

## Customization

All workflows can be customized for your specific needs:

1. Copy the template
2. Modify queries, prompts, or checklists
3. Save as a new workflow
4. Share with your team

## Contributing

To add new workflows:

1. Create a descriptive filename
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add usage examples
4. Test thoroughly before committing

## Overview

Warp University provides battle-tested workflows and implementations for modern development teams. This framework brings together:

- **Intelligent Workflows**: Pre-configured prompts and commands for common development tasks
- **MCP Server Integration**: Ready-to-use implementations for Figma, Linear, Puppeteer, Sentry, and Context7
- **Automation at Scale**: Parallel execution patterns and monorepo synchronization
- **Security-First Approach**: Built-in secrets prevention and security testing
- **Production-Ready DevOps**: Docker configurations and cloud infrastructure patterns

## Quick Start

1. Browse individual directories for specific implementations
2. Each subdirectory contains a detailed README with usage examples
3. Copy and adapt workflows to your specific needs
4. Follow security best practices outlined in the security/ directory

## Key Features

### Workflows
- SQL REPL command templates for database interaction
- Automated testing prompt frameworks
- Pull request review workflows
- Agent profile configurations for consistent AI assistance

### MCP Servers
- **Figma MCP**: Design system integration and asset management
- **Linear MCP**: Issue tracking and project management automation
- **Puppeteer MCP**: Browser automation for testing and scraping
- **Sentry MCP**: Error tracking and monitoring integration
- **Context7 MCP**: Enhanced context management for AI workflows

### Automation
- Parallel task execution patterns
- Monorepo synchronization rules
- CI/CD pipeline templates
- Automated deployment workflows

### Security
- Secrets detection and prevention systems
- Security testing frameworks
- Vulnerability scanning automation
- Compliance checking tools

### DevOps
- Production-grade Docker configurations
- Cloud log analysis patterns
- Database optimization strategies
- Infrastructure as Code templates

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with Documentation**: Review the documentation/ directory for comprehensive guides
2. **Adapt to Your Stack**: These implementations are templates - customize them for your tech stack
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test workflows in development before production use
4. **Security First**: Implement security/ patterns before deploying any automation
5. **Iterate and Improve**: Use these as starting points and enhance based on your team's needs
